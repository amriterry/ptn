He was trying to have dinner at the same time. But due to his tiredness he could not do either of them and soon dozed off.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then a conversation about a house call between a small girl and his wife at his door woke him up. The child was saying that her mother was very ill and was dying soon. The doctor came to the door, talked to the girl. The girl of six or seven was thin and wearing cotton dress and shabby shoes. Dr. Emil became ready with his coat, hat and little black box despite his wife&rsquo;s disagreement.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It was raining lightly. On the way the doctor tried to catch up the girl to ask some questions but the girl kept the distance between them and stopped for a short time only at the corners to make sure that the doctor was following.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The girl took him through the poorest part of Berlin, the section of the city around the hospital where he worked. Finally, the girl led him to an old house. They climbed the stairs through the dark hallway. The doctor tried to catch the girl on the stairs also but failed again. However, he felt energetic to climb up the stairs as if he was young. On the fifth floor the girl led the doctor to a room where woman was lying on a single bed. The girl thanked the doctor as he moved in and softly shut the door from outside. The elderly doctor easily recognized the woman. She worked as maintenance staff in the same hospital three years before. The doctor easily found out that the woman was suffering from pneumonia and gave her some medicine. He asked her if she had gone to live with her brother in country. The woman replied that she had gone but she had come back three months ago after her child&rsquo;s death. They talked about the woman&rsquo;s daughter confusingly. Then the woman showed her daughter&rsquo;s shawl and shoes to the doctor in the corner of the room. The doctor examined them carefully. The doctor touched them and felt that they were wet. He was astonished to this. Then the woman said that there might have been some confusion about the girl who called the doctor. The doctor agreed. The woman said that she had been thinking about him and he came which was strange. The woman slept with her half sentence and the doctor left the room.</p>','2014-05-28 01:54:23',5,1,NULL,2,1,0,0),(2,'The Recurring Dream','<p><strong>THE RECURRING DREAM</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">-A story from England<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Characters</strong><br /><strong>Kimblerly Clark</strong> &ndash; Protagnasit (Main Character)<br /><strong>Janet Wilson</strong> &ndash; Roomate<br /><strong>Old man</strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Theme</strong><br />-Outlet of suprresed Desire<br />-Link of dream and Reality</p>\r\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The story starts with a description of Kimberly Clark, the protagonist of the story, who is twenty five yeas old with all qualities of a normal young woman. She is pretty, she loves to dance, and she has many friends and a good position in the office of a large company. Despite these all, she has a problem. She has been troubled by a strange and mysterious dream that haunts her every night. <a name=\"more\"></a></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The strange dream always begins on a country road. Kim stands on this road and sees a lane with a white fence and a hedge on each side. At the end of the lane, on the top of a little hill, she sees a small white cottage with green shutters. Then she walks up the lane to the house, goes in and looks around. In one of the rooms, she finds a man asleep in bed. He is a little old man with white hair and a white heard. When she comes near his bed, the man wakes up. Then he sits up and looks at her. When she tries to speak to him, she wakes up. She is very surprised troubled by the dream because she has never known any little old man like that and neither the place.</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kim&rsquo;s roommate knows everything. So, one day she proposes Kim to visit her (Janet&rsquo;s) parents&rsquo; farm house to feel peace in mind. As they pass through a country road, Kim sees the similar scene which she sees in her dream. They stop there. Janet does not want Kim to go and see the small cottage but Kim goes.</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The house was exactly the same, except for a sign in front of the house which said &lsquo;FOR SALE&rsquo;. Unlike her dream, Kim goes to the door of the house and knocks and to her surprise the same old man answers the door who immediately closes the door. After Kim&rsquo;s request, he opens the door. Kim again asks why the house is for sale. The old man reveals that the house is haunted by a ghost. Kim tries hard to think to say something instead asks who the ghost is. The old man gets surprised and shocks her by replying that she herself is the ghost.</div>','2014-05-28 11:16:04',5,1,NULL,2,1,0,0),(3,'The Recurring dream','<p><strong>Why do you think Kim has this dream?</strong><br />&ldquo;The Recurring Dream&rdquo; is the story from England.It is the story of Kim who has the same dream regularly. I think Kim has the same dream again and again because of her supressed desire and stressed mind.</p>\r\n<p>The father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Frued said that &ldquo;Dreams are fulfilled of repressed desire.&rdquo; In the story , Kim has a normal ife, easy going.She lives and works in London,is pretty and young.But she has a mysterious dream time and again.She dream she is on a country road.She stands stands on this this road and sees a lanewith white fence and hedge on a both side.At the end of the lane is a white cottage with green shutters .She goes inside the house and finds a man with whitw beard and white hair.She comes near to the bed and tries to speak to the man but everytime when she tries to talk to the old man, she wakes up.I think she has this dream regularly because deep inside her she has a desire to leave the busy town and live in quiet peaceful environment.In the dream,there is an ld man.Also , no family of Kim are shown in the story.Kim want someone who can take care of her like her parents.The old man is like father figure to Kim. Also, due to the dream she is stressed and thinks about it way too much. Her work in company also adds the stress making her want peace and quiet environment.</p>\r\n<p>So, I think the main reason Kim has this dream is because of her supressed desire and stressful life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you think is the reason for the pepole having recuriing deams?</strong><br />Signund Fried, the father of psychoanlaysis said that, &rdquo;Dreams are disguised fulfilment of supressed desire&rdquo;.Dreams are the series of thought image sensations occuring in the mind during sleep. Dreams is common to all i.e. all people dream during their sleep. But some people dream the same thing frequently. I think some of the main cause for this recurring dream are supressed desire,stress,psycological problem and others.</p>\r\n<p><br />Mankind have a lot of desire.all of those desires are not possible to be fulfilled. But people have huge wishes to gett what the dream of. So, The dream shows our desire that are supressed deep inside of us and not fulfilled. Also ,when people stress about the same thing for a long period of time, the dream may occur frequently.Maybe pepople have some physical problem. Like seeing things really not present (hallucination) then they might also have a repeated series of the same dream. In such case Kim in the given story,it is showed that she have a busy life. Due to this busy scheudle she may not have been able to fullfil her desires.In this dream she always goes to the country side where there is a lane with white fence and hedge on both side and a cottage at the end of the lane.Since,she live in town, may be her desire are to have a peace, quite life.Also,there is an old man in her dream.This can also be taken as her lack of family affection and love.The old man shown in the story can be taken as a faher to Kim.Kim&rsquo;s life,though seem easy,was stressful enough due to this dream.She used to stress too much about the dream.It is said that she used to see it frequently at beginning.May be she stressed too much about it,which caused to occur on real basis.</p>\r\n<p><br /> In short,I think the reasons for reccuring dream are stress,supressed desire and psycological problems.</p>','2014-05-28 11:17:51',5,2,NULL,2,1,0,0),(4,'The House Call','<p><strong>If the doctor was too tired to eat or sleep, why was he not too tired to go to see the sick women?</strong><br />The doctor was too tired to eat or sleep but went to see the sick woman. This is because the doctor was a religious person and he believed he was to fulfill anything god will put in front of him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why do you think the little girl walked ahead of the doctor instead of walking with him?</strong><br />She was a Spirit who doesn&rsquo;t want to reveal her secret. So, In order to avoid the conversation with the doctor, she walked ahead.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Write a paragraph describing Dr. Braun?</strong><br />Dr. Braun full name is Emil Brown who is 67 years old. He is a very religious kind of a person who will do whatever god put in front of him. He was a famous a head Surgeon at the hospital. He put his duty in front of everything else.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do you think it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep remainders of lost loved ones as Elda did?</strong><br />No. I think the best gift we can gave to our lost loved one is to forget them because our love one wouldn&rsquo;t want to see our suffering. In case, we keep some remainder of lost one, then we will always remember what we had and lost. It&rsquo;s just a waste of time. It won&rsquo;t give any benefit to the lost one or us. Life will be very hard remembering the happy days in sad times. So you should learn from your past. WE should rather believe in future.<br />Do you think Elda&rsquo;s Hoping and praying had anything to do with the doctor&rsquo;s coming to see her? Explain<br />Yes, BECAUSE the little girl who got the doctor must have heard her mother&rsquo;s prayer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Write a paragraph explaining why do or don&rsquo;t believe that people stime appear after Death, like this in the story?</strong><br />Our body consisted of the physical body and soul. Once we die physical body dies but our soul, it moves from one place to another. If there is something the soul wants badly or something the soul left undone, the soul comes back.

She is beautiful, right, kind and loving child. However, she is sick from the day of her birth. As time passes, she becomes more and more weak and finally she dies when she turns four. Since everyone in the village loves the child, all of them attend her funeral. They bury the child in the cemetery outside the village. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;After some days, Rosa gives Carmen&rsquo;s clothes and playthings to the priest from another village. She gives them so that she will be able to forget Carmen easily. Moreover, the doctor says that she won&rsquo;t be able to give birth to another baby after Carmen. But Roberto doesn&rsquo;t become happy to hear this. He wants to save the things because he still hopes that Rosa will give birth to another child. He consoles her that because Rosa was busy in taking care of Carmen, god didn&rsquo;t send her another child. Roberto then remembers the doll with which Carmen often used to play and asks Rosa whether she has given that doll too. But Rosa says the doll was not with other things. They search for the doll everywhere but they can&rsquo;t find it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rosa becomes pregnant and on the first anniversary of the death of Carmen she gives birth to another baby. It was good news for them so the priest also gives the name &lsquo;Evangelina&rsquo; to the child which means good news. As Evangelina grows up she looks more and more like Carmen. Her actions and characters are also similar to her sister. The only difference is that Evangelina is healthy. One day, when Evangelina turns four, she asks her mother whether she was sick for a long time back. But the mother says it was not she but her sister was sick. Evangelina insists that she remembers it very well and also asks her auntie about it. She also adds that she had a doll with blue eyes and red dress and she had put it under a big tree in the yard. She then takes them to that place and asks to dig there. When they dig the ground they find the doll there. Rosa can&rsquo;t believe her eyes and becomes speechless. But when Rosa&rsquo;s sister asks Evangelina to tell everything about what she remembers, she says that when she was sick the priest prayed with his hand on her head. Then she went to sleep. A real nice man woke her up and took her. But he didn&rsquo;t allow her to take the doll with her. So, she put the doll under the tree. Rosa becomes shocked when she hears the whole story. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; This is the story of reincarnation or rebirth in which Carmen is reborn as Evangelina.

He heard the knock again thought it was caused due to wind. When he heard the knock for the third time, that was louder than before, he thought it was emergency. He went to the door, lifted the shade and put on the outside who seemed very nervous. He thought it might be the trick of women to rob him, so he said the shop had been closed and said to come on next morning.

She seemed abnormally pale, had shoulder length hair and she was wearing simple kimono that seem it had been worn to bed. He gave her an ame and paying money for it, she went quickly. Sakota stops working and thought about the woman. He found the woman quite mysterious. Her eye shows that she was from another world. The same thing repeated for another two nights. He wanted to ask her why she had not come on the day time but forgot when she was there. One night he asked his friend to take the photo of the woman to look at her face clearly. When she came again his friend took a photograph hiding behind the door, to their surprise the woman was not seen though they had seen her through the lens of camera. They decided to follow her if she came again.<br />When she came again they followed after she went away from the store. She didn&rsquo;t mind them coming after her. Actually, she acted as if she wanted to be followed. After walking for some time she enters a building, goes up to the third floor and disappears. They saw an open door open and went inside. There in the room they saw a baby licking an ame. There was the person who was sleeping beside the baby. They were surprised to see the woman sleeping so fast.

In the poem, the poet describes the beauty of nature and shows his love and devotion towards nature. The poet recollects an experience of his childhood days and gives meaning to his emotions and feelings. Through his poem, the poet also shows the thread of human life i.e. progress or stages of our life.</p>\r\n<p>Wordsworth was a lover of nature. He worshiped the things of nature as god. He enjoyed the beauty of nature every time. In the poem, he says that when he sees the rainbow in the sky, he becomes very happy. Rainbow is the example of the beautiful creation of the nature. It looks really beautiful in the combination of seven colors. The poet further says that he used to happy when he saw the rainbow in the sky during his childhood days. The feeling of happiness for the rainbow is same in him as a young man at present. And he hopes to have the same types of feeling for the rainbow in future as well. He says that if he can\'t continue to have such feelings for nature in his future life, he feels it will be better for him to die.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the poet expresses his wish for the future. He wishes to continue his love for the nature. In a sense, he wants to spend his future days worshiping the natural things. It is written in nine lies in which he has been able to show his love and devotion for nature and its beauty.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The paradox in \"The child is father of the man.\" &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the poem, the poet says \'The child is father of the man.\' This proverb seems to be paradoxical as we consider the man to be father of man. But the poet wants to say that childhood is the base of every man\'s life because from childhood, manhood begins. Man enters the living world and starts to know life from his childhood. It determines the coming stages of our life. It is often said, morning shows the day, and in this context, it is obvious that the person shows same characters in his manhood which he gained or developed in childhood. In another words, the poet means to say that present is the outcome of the past so the future will be the outcome of the present. It indicates, the beginning of everything is very important. Here, the word father means the one from whom something begins. So it means, childhood is the foundation of manhood. A man goes towards his destiny which he determined himself in childhood. This indirectly points to the fact that man is himself controlled through his own childhood.&nbsp;Thus, childhood is the foundation of manhood and a child has roles as of father to play at present to mould himself in future as a man.</p>','2014-05-29 13:57:51',5,1,NULL,2,1,0,0),(13,'My Heart Leaps When I Behold','<ol>\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;Write in one sentence what poem is about?</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poem is love and respect towards the nature towards the nature.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Explain the paradox in &ldquo;The child is a father of man&rdquo;?</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child is a father of the man. William Wordswroth quoted it in his poem; I think a child is a father of man because of his proximity to nature. A child is innocent and is close to nature. S/he plays in nature, spend times in nature and grow up in the nature. Due to this innocence they are superior to those men who don&rsquo;t have time for their own work and don&rsquo;t care about nature. Moreover a mad of today was a child of yesterday and a child of today will be a man tomorrow, AS morning shows the day, Childhood determines the manhood of a man, those who had good learning in childhood turns to be a good person and likewise. Their learning in childhood is what makes them closer to nature and father of man.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Summaries the poem in a paragraph.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;MY heart leaps when I behold is a poem written by William Wordsworth. He shows his love to nature through his poem. He said he becomes happy when he sees the rainbow, in the nature. His life begins then in nature. He feels joyful when he sees the colorful rainbow, the rainbow stays the same when he turned into a man and grew old. If the nature didn&rsquo;t exist or died as we grow up, then the poet says, he doesn&rsquo;t want to live. A life without nature is meaningless. Even nature makes a child father of man. The closeness of child to nature and his ability to understand nature is vast.

Sometimes, in certain lights it is so pale, it doesn&rsquo;t seem green at all.It is shiny, and there are thin bands of gold cup and again midway down th bowl of the cup and it&rsquo;s base, which is subtly formed into a semi-pedestal. There is also a band of gold on the inner circle of the saucer,but it has been worn away after so many years of use. Inside the cup there are flowers, as if some one has scattered a bouquet and it had tumbled into seperate blossoms, falling in a full circke around the inside.Some had already fallen wheras some were still falling.No flowers in the cup were simillar.<br /> <br />The cup was one part of the history not beacuse it was too old but it had lived through the destruction cauesd by Second Wolrd war. Many and many things fell that yeat but the cup was still safe. In other way, the cup was safe because someone had looked after it.

The second world war was the most devasting war of man kind, Many inncocent, were killed and Billions of worth Property were destroyed.And even in Barcelona, almost for the 1st time in history a woman carrying a bunch of Forsythia wrapped in waxed paper ran for cover,hidding from air.The newborns died without seeing what world had to offerm Many women wrere widowed and many childern were Orpahned. Humanity had also Died along with the war. So, this war brought down everything along with it.</p>\r\n<p>In short, the lines wants to say how we could have protected ourself or avoided the second world war by only taking good care of our own nation.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>What do you mean by&rdquo; Many things fell that year&rdquo;?</strong><br />&ldquo;Many things fell that year&rdquo;. This line is reffereing to the year 1939, begginning of the seound world war. In 1939,everything fell. The flowers in the tea cup fell, This symbolically represent Bombs falling from the year adn some already landed taking thousands and thousand sof inncoents lives. Just like the flowers in tea cup, the bombs were landing, Many dead bodies have fallen that year.</p>\r\n<p>When there is a war,development also stops.once development stops, a country falls.In1939,the country fell,thery wew never upgraded again.Just like Czekoslovakia, the cup made were sold but the skill had alreaday fell.Our own human civilization which taught us our lessons and kindness fell. For the first time bodies of bride paired with other bodies fell on bed. Our Tradition and culture lesson fell.They proved to be wrong.All dreams and hopes one had for fututre fell due to the war only because one had to serve the country.Many women were widowed and many men were killed.This decreased the faith in marriage and finally faith in marriage fell. War had made men cruel and didnt care about anyone else . So, the greatest of all humanity fell that year.</p>\r\n<p>So, everything fell that year starting from falling of flowers to humanity.</p>\r\n<p>3.<strong> How does Hampel see herself and her mother connected by the tea cup?</strong><br />\"Look at the tea cup\" is a essay that is completly depended upon the tea cup.Here the tea cup is the medium for all questioned asked in the essay.The tea cup was brought by Hampel mother in 1939.She preserved it and handed it to her daughter.</p>\r\n<p><br />The essay talks about the realtionships of mother and daughter.In this essay the mother is a silent kind of women. Whereas her daughter is a talkative one.The daughter wants to know many things about the past.But her mother sayd that there was no significant in her life.But the daughter didnt agree.Beacuse she had survived the war. At that time even europe started to eat itself raw.The daughter however thought her life was very significant due to it. The mother passed down the teacup as a soviner. This is where all the questions start to rise.The daughter looks at the cup and all the questions abut her mother past stars to come out.This cup has helped her to understand the life of her mother life better than ever before. She understood the life of women in 1939 because of her mother. The mother doesnt talk about her life.This shows the way a women wants to keep all her pain to herself.</p>\r\n<p>In short, the tea cup is where all the sumberged figure starts coming out and all the past connected to her mother comes out.</p>','2014-05-29 14:03:20',5,2,NULL,5,1,0,0),(48,'Cytology,Cell and Cell totipotency','<h4>Cell biology</h4>\r\n<p>It is the branch of science which we study about structure and function of cell.</p>\r\n<h4>Cytology</h4>\r\n<p>It is the branch of biology in which we study about the structure, components, function and cell division.</p>\r\n<h4>Cell</h4>\r\n<p>The term cell was derived from the Latin word &lsquo;Cella&rsquo; which refers to the empty compartments or cell. It can be defined as the basic structural and functional unit of life because it gives shape of body of different living organisms Except WBC &amp; amoeba. It also carries out all the biological process. All the living organisms are made up of cell.</p>\r\n<h4>History of Cell</h4>\r\n<p>After the invention of microscope the cell was discovered by physicist Robert hook in 1665. During his period he took a slice of a cork and observed under the microscope, he found that there are number of empty compartments like honey comb. He named each Compartment as a cell. The he took again a Slice of living parts as roots, stem, leaf etc. and observed under the microscope. In this case Number of chambers was observed but each chambered compartment contains something inside it, such chambers are named as cell.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;The cell Theory</h4>\r\n<p>Cell theory was first coined by the Scheleiden and Schwann in 1839. According to the Scheleiden all the plant bodies are made up of cells and similarly According to the Schwann all the animal bodies are made up of cell. Now the combined Views of both scientists Forms a theory called Cell Theory.This theory states that</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the living bodies are made up of cells.</p>\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This cells are derived from the Pre-existing cells</p>\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the living bodies have basically similar properties, compounds &amp;activities.</p>\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the functions carried out by the living organisms are activities and interaction of cell components.</p>\r\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growth and development takes place in unicellular organisms by cellular growth. But in case of multi cellular organisms it takes place by cell division.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Drawbacks Of cell theory</h4>\r\n<p>The theory can&rsquo;t be applied in all cases. There are some weak points which cannot be explained by this theory. They are:-</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bacteria and cyanobacteria don&rsquo;t contain complete nucleus. It only has got a naked bundle of chromosome. Such nucleus is called indefinite, incipient or Nucoid.</p>\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In virus, there is no cellular organization. It has only DNA or RNA &amp; protein</p>\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some primitive algae and fungi protoplasm is not spates &amp; multinucleated. Such type of body is called Coenocyte body.</p>\r\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many nonliving things which are found inside the cell but the cell theory can&rsquo;t explain non-living things.</p>\r\n<h4>Cellular totipotency</h4>\r\n<p>All the vegetative cells of the plant body have got the potentiality to form the entire plant; such capacity of the plant is called cellular totipotency. It was first coined by Hoertland in 1902 &amp; experimentally proved by the F.C steward in 1957.</p>\r\n<h4>Steward Experiment</h4>\r\n<p>The experiment was performed in the carrot root. He took a few phloem cells from the carrot root and kept in the culture tube containing artificially prepared medium and coconut milk. Then grow under the controlled environment. After few days the phloem cells divide repeatedly divides and produce young embryo. Now the embryo is then transferred into next culture tube containing same nutrition. Then it further develops and then produces young plantlet and it is transferred in a pot and grew up in the open environment. Each plantlet develops into the entire plant. In this way, steward proved that entire plant is produced from the phloem cells. Such capacity of cell is called cellular-totipotency.</p>\r\n<h4>Types of living Body</h4>\r\n<p>According to number of cells there are two types of living organisms. They are:-</p>\r\n<h3>Unicellular organism</h3>\r\n<p>If the living body is made up of single cell and those living organisms are called unicellular organisms. It has simple structure and carries all the biological process E.g. amoeba, paramecium</p>\r\n<h4>Multicellular organism</h4>\r\n<p>If the living body is made up of more than one cell then it is call multicellular organism. The structure of multicellular living organism is more complex with increasing the number of cells. In case of multicellular, zygote divide many times to form mass of cells among them grouping and division of labor take place. Each group of cell is called tissue. And the numbers of systems produce life in this way cell, tissue organ, systems are interrelated to each other.</p>\r\n<h4>Flow of energy through cell</h4>\r\n<p>In the living beings to carry out the function, cell needs the constant supply of energy. In this living world earth, Sun is the major source of energy. The sunlight is captured by the chloroplast by the green cell. And then prepare the food with the help of photosynthesis process. Then some of the food is transferred to the animals or non-green plants in the form of grains, root, fruits etc.</p>\r\n<p>In the green cell, the foods produced by the photosynthesis are transferred to the mitochondria and then the food get oxidized and turned to the energy. Some of the energy is transferred to the cell to carry out the system activities. And the remaining amount of the energy is stored in the form of ATP. In the absence of food in the cell, mitochondrion releases the energy to run the system in the cell. So-called the power house of the cell.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly in the Non-green plants or animals; the food provided by the green cell is transferred to the mitochondria. And the oxidation of food takes place. And some amount of energy is used by the cell to run the system but the remaining amount of energy is stored in mitochondria in the form of energy. And whenever the crisis of energy takes place it release he energy so called the power house of cell.</p>','2014-06-03 21:56:43',3,1,NULL,4,1,0,0),(47,'Keeping Things Whole','<p><strong>Keeping Things Whole</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">-Mark Strand</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Human quest of finding wholeness</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mark&nbsp;<span id=\"s90au10i_6\" class=\"s90au10i\">Strand</span>&nbsp;in his poem&nbsp;&ldquo;Keeping things Whole&rdquo;&nbsp;expresses that&nbsp;<span id=\"s90au10i_3\" class=\"s90au10i\">human beings</span>&nbsp;always disturb the nature whereas nature always makes a balance to keep itself intact.

The main thrust of this essay is: what is going to happen if we do not conserve the world&rsquo;s natural resources. Asimov focuses on a specific problem that will arise by the lack of fuels. This whole world is run by different resources such as petrol, diesel, water, wood, etc. We cannot imagine this world without the use of fuel. In comparison to the past days, we are now facing the problem of scarcity of fuel resources. Earlier these resources were found in large quantity and life style was easier.<a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8980101433934957741\" name=\"more\"></a></div>\r\n<div>As the fuel resources were abundantly found, every sector was found running successfully and easily. Factories, industries, transportation, great organizations, etc. were in proper condition. People didn&rsquo;t have problem of scarcity of fuel resources. But slowly and gradually population growth increased and brought bad consequences. Agricultural lands were occupied by huge buildings and industries. Also, the number of vehicles also increased. Due to the maximum use of the resources, human life has been in discomfort. Human beings feel that their lives are really unsecured. They always have fear that they will lose work and food. They think that they are themselves responsible for causing scarcity of resources. As they are less conscious of their future, they suffer because of the destruction of the resources. Most of them claim that they will have new resources invented. Of course, new resources such as nuclear energy and solar power have been discovered but they are very dangerous and also expensive in use. People know that their pleasures are in danger and also their future is dark. Coming generations will suffer more than us.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Asimov focuses on the decreasing resources of fuel in the world. The life will be full of struggle without fuel resources. This world will slowly go dark, as less lighting bulbs will be there in the streets. Electrical appliances will be used less as there will also be scarcity of electricity. Even luxurious provisions and equipments will be impossible. More time will be taken to do simple work also as there won&rsquo;t be any vehicle running in the streets. There will be difficulty in transportation and accumulation of required foodstuffs. Due to the shortage of food, people will die due to starvation and malnutrition. Due to lack of proper balanced diet, there will be problem in human brains. Child death rate will increase, as children will be deprived of proper nutritious and body building food. Specially, simple towns, suburbs will be affected much. These areas depend upon transportation for all kinds of things. They will be in danger of extinction. Every human activity will be minimized due to less light, heat, and less comfort. Security forces will also be affected badly. Without the use of weapons, military forces will be purposeless. Their work will end because they can&rsquo;t work without fuel. They use scientific weapons, which are operated with fuel and are very expensive. Only the technically strong countries will be able to exercise their military power if fuel is saved in time. Factory workers will be jobless as industries and factories will be closed. So, it will be very difficult for them to provide basic needs to their family also.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Only small benefits will be there due to lack of fuel. The environment will be fresh, cool and pure. Crime rates will decrease. People will understand the importance of nature and will go attached with it. People will be cooperative, as all of them will be facing same problem. They will keep themselves warm using sweaters and other thick clothes only.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The writer tries to warn us from the devastating situation of this world in the coming future. If we are not serious at present only, we have to suffer a lot in the future. We must understand the importance of the nature and try to conserve it. The world is depending upon the trade and because of trade the environment is being neglected. People are living in the cities and the environment of the cities is polluted. Major population of world should be engaged to plant the trees to make a better world in future. We cannot use the solar easily and even if we use, it cannot naturally help us. But if we preserve the jungle, our environment and energy will be improved.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Synopsis of the Essay</strong></div>\r\n<div>The present essay written by the Russian writer Isaac Asimov basically concerns about the fuel shortage in the present world. He has given us the instances from America about how the fuel shortage directly or indirectly relates to human life and its adverse impacts. The writer kindly advises us to preserve the existing natural resources that give us the enormous fuel to sustain life. The essay &ldquo;The Nightmare Life Without Fuel,&rdquo; originally published in the Time Magazine in 1977, portrays America in the late 1990s, where the existing fuel resources have reduced this developed and rich nation to miserable condition of dark and dirty replica of the pre-industrial 1800s. America is just a small example to show how dwindling fuel resources have been reducing. The central essence of this essay is considerable that the worst condition may coome if we do not preserve the natural resources of the world.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The writer describes the terrific situation in the urban areas of America where people are wandering here and there for the fuel and energy. People gather in the subways where the bus is already left and bicycles are splashed on the muddy water, which indicates difficulties in life due to shortage of fuel. Coal is difficult to get by digging and nuclear fusion is very risky and then the solar batteries are very costly. The stuff of the decaying city should be the mineral mines to use again.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>There are several adverse impacts on human life due to fuel shortage; but the writer says that this kind of shortage would be beneficial to some extent. Automobiles are vanished and become the metal resources; likewise the ration system also will decrease. According to the writer, there are reports from the newspapers in 1997 that the environment becomes cleaner, crime rates are reduced and the policemen are returned to their beats. The streets are deserted and the legs of the people become superior in the street. People do not consume the expensive electricity; they are deprived of modern facilities. For them open air is the air condition and homemade sweaters are popular indoor wear.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The people in the city feel comfort rather than the people in suburbs. Energy crisis is the vital problem for the city dwellers. The nation should find the alternative source of energy to soothe the growing population. The condition outside USA and Europe is even worse and the people do not have sufficient food stuff to eat; only about one in five has enough food to eat. Rest of people would die of starvation. But the writer states that starvation reduces the world&rsquo;s population and more than two billion people suffer from brain damage due to less nutritious food. The fuel resources are limited, so it has the great impact on human life. The energy crisis is continued and as a result, the world&rsquo;s countries would not afford their cost, keep their soldiers for the long time and unable to feed their people properly. Because of fuel shortage, the electricity is not possible, the people will deprive of watching TV, movie and reading books and they will ultimately return to the age of 1800. Then the existing fossil fuel (natural fuel produced by decomposition of organic) will work out.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The agricultural system will also be destroyed, the new technologies will be halted due to fuel crisis and farmer cannot produce enough crops to sustain people&rsquo;s life. As a result more people will die of starvation. The situation will be havoc, to cope with such situation, we had to take step to improve the situation 50 years ago, and then it would have been quite better to cope with fuel crisis.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It is indeed a serious issue to preserve the dwindling natural resources and if we do not think positively, it will devastate our society, and nation which are completely depended on fuel. The general people on the outskirt of the city (suburbs) will die untimely because of fuel shortage. The condition of poor nation will be perilous and the women and children&rsquo;s mortality rate will increase and those who remain alive also suffer from bad health. But in the case of rich nation, it won&rsquo;t be serious problem, they can afford their necessities and there will be the wider distinction between poor and rich people.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Finally the writer recommends us the possible solution of the current fuel crisis in the world. He strongly suggests preserving the natural resources though it is very late. The remaining natural resources will also make us relieve if we seriously ponder about it and do something for the sake of natural resources to tackle the fuel crisis.</div>\r\n<div>According to the essay fuel crisis will have following advantages and disadvantage:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It has the following&nbsp;<strong>advantages</strong>:<br /><ol>\r\n<li>There will no smoke from vehicles and industries so the air will be pollution free.</li>\r\n<li>Less people will suffer from cough and cold because of pollution free air.</li>\r\n<li>Crime rate will fall down because of mutual protection in crowd.</li>\r\n<li>Due to lack of other entertainment facilities, people will start utilizing natural source of entertainment.</li>\r\n<li>People will learn to live natural life without facilities such as central heating, shower bath with hot water etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\nThe following will be the&nbsp;<strong>disadvantages of fuel crisis</strong>:<br /><ol>\r\n<li>People will be deprived from facilities which will make their life complicated.</li>\r\n<li>People will have to walk and carry goods by themselves.</li>\r\n<li>People living in suburbs will face acute problem bringing and storing food.</li>\r\n<li>High percentage of people will have health problems, even sustain brain damage</li>\r\n<li>Entertainment and printing materials will be curtailed depriving people from getting even information and news.</li>\r\n<li>There will be high death rate of infants as their mothers will go dry.</li>\r\n</ol></div>','2014-05-29 14:13:01',5,1,NULL,5,1,0,0),(20,'The NightMare life without Fuel','<p><strong>1. According to the author, what will be the advantage of the fuel crisis?</strong><br />Ans: To begin with it should be very clear that there&rsquo;s no advantage at all of fuel crisis. Still, however, the writer has mentioned some advantages of it. But, they are mentioned ironically.<br /> The first advantage of fuel crisis is that the air will be cleaner and there will be no air pollution. People will have fewer colds. People will walk freely in the streets and there will be no danger of accidents. The parks will be full. On the top of everything, people will communicate with each other freely and more frequently. There will be fewer crimes and the policemen will be back to their beats.<br /> On the other hand, there will be peace in the world. Only the United States and the Soviet Union will have some aero planes, ships and tankers. Even these countries will not be able to use such things. People will use things like sweaters, blankets and they will have fresh air in summer. People will complete their daily activities by the evening and will go to beds early at nights.<br /> There are many disadvantages of fuel crisis. All the scientific progress will come to a stop. The factories will be closed and there will be full unemployment. At the same time, there will be a total lack of different products in the market.<br /> Due to the lack of transportation, people of one end of the world will die out of hunger whereas there will be food supply in the other part of the world. Similarly, medicines also cannot be sent from one part of the world to another. In those countries where there will be lack of food, thousands of people will suffer from malnutrition and brain damage. All the activities will come to an end. Machines will be replaced by physical labour of human muscles and animals. In short, all the scientific progress will stop and human civilization will go back to the time before the industrial revolution or Stone Age.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>2. In Asimov&rsquo;s essay, what is happening in the rest of the world as America struggles without&nbsp;fuel?</strong><br />Ans: The writer shows a very dismal picture of the rest of the world as America struggles without fuel. People will be starving in many parts of the world. Perhaps, not more than one in five will have enough to eat. There will be a high rate of infant mortality. Due to the lack of food, there will be many cases of permanent brain damage by under nutrition. So much so, many such people will have to be killed out of mercy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. What does the author mean when he says, &ldquo;the suburbs were born with the auto, lived&nbsp;with the auto, and are dying with the auto.&rdquo;</strong> <br />Ans:&nbsp;Suburbs are the areas just outside the large cities. With rapid industrialization and development, the cities became crowded. Therefore people started living little away from the cities enjoying equal opportunities as cities. Because of easy availability of automobiles (vehicles), the suburbs were come into existence. People living in the suburbs are fully dependent on the cities for educational, medical facilities, for their employment and for their daily provisions. Due to easy vehicular movement, they are living happily availing facilities like cities. Now with the fuel crisis, there to and from movements to the city and vice-versa are restricted because of non availability of vehicles.

Joining the chopped parts of trees refers to the new plantation of more trees in the open fields, which are full of stumps. Every part of trees refers to the every parts of the nature whether they are small or big. Each and every parts of nature is important. As we are also the creation of the nature, it is our duty to maintain the balance in the nature. We don&rsquo;t have rights to destroy the nature. Actually we are not destroying the nature but we are destroying ourselves. Our lives totally depend upon the nature. Through the writer&rsquo;s appeal to join the parts of the chopped trees, he wants to remind human beings about their important works to be done to conserve the greenery of the nature.</p>\r\n<p>Unchopping a tree is impossible. It is only a kind of feeling but certainly it has meaning. The writer emphasizes on the preservation of the nature. The nature should be preserved and those persons who cur the trees must plant some more in replacement. When they save and plant the trees, it is unchopping a tree. The writer warns that it is easy to destroy but very hard to create. He further says that life of a tree and human life are the same so they should be preserved with equal emphasis. Not only the trees we should save but also should protect the habitats of some animals who live in trees.</p>\r\n<p>The writer tries to persuade us how to work hard to bring the chopped tree into the original situation, which is not really possible. When a tree is felled down, there is no way to bring it into its original condition. But its place can be replaced with more trees, which we plant. Trees are also the important parts of the ecosystem as other living creatures. We should think of conservation of such trees instead of deforestation for the protection of the ecosystem.</p>','2014-05-29 14:17:35',5,1,NULL,5,1,0,0),(23,'The Three Day Blow','<p><br /><strong>The Three Day Blow</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">-Ernest Hemingway&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Characters</strong><br /><strong>Nick &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Protagonist (Main Character)<br /><strong>Bill &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Nick&rsquo;s Friend<br /><strong>Marjorie &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Nick&rsquo;s Girlfriend</p>\r\n<p><strong>Settings</strong><br />Stormy weather autumn(fall)<br />Bill&rsquo;s House<br />Psychological Plot</p>\r\n<p><strong>Themes</strong><br />Love<br />Friendship<br />Relationships<br />Drinking</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Summary</strong></p>\r\n<p>The story only has two major characters, Nick and Bill (Marge, Nick&rsquo;s father, and Bill&rsquo;s father are mentioned but do not make an appearance), and the entire story takes place either inside or outside of Bill&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s cottage.</p>\r\n<p>The story begins with Nick walking around the orchard near the cabin.

This poem talks about alienations, treating darkness and doubleness of man. This whole poem is the writer&rsquo;s quest to find his identity and wholeness in life.<br />Life is a journey, it is continuous. IT never stops. The poem in this essay is also travelling the same journey, He is trying to find his missing identity in his life, In a field, he stands and sees but he is still absent there, That is because he doesn&rsquo;t belong there, The poet&rsquo;s case is same everywhere. Whenever he goes he is always missing. The poet journey to find wholeness but all he see so he work is more fragmentation, He part the air as he walk and his space is soon replaced. That is because he has done nothing significant in his life. So when he looks back at his past himself, he doesn&rsquo;t find anyone. His space is already taken. So, he moves on and on to find himself to give meaning to his life and have a special remembrance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Write the central idea of the poem.</strong><br />Ans: We human beings move from one place to another place to fulfill our purpose. We all have our own purposes for moving. When we move from one place to another place, we divide the air but the air moves in to fulfill the place from where we have gone through. Similarly we become absent in the place which we leave. According to the poet this happiness all the time in our life, we try to do wholeness/completeness but everything remains incomplete. When we solve one problem, other problems move in like air moves in. In the same way we find something missing in the first place when we go to another place.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2014-05-29 14:22:08',5,2,NULL,5,1,0,0),(26,'Concrete Cat','<p><strong>Concrete Cat</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Dorthi Charles</p>\r\n<p>Concrete cat is a concrete poem. A concrete poem is an experimental poem, which verbally deals with visual ideas with an attempt to articulate visual thinking and bring the aesthetic principle of paintings into the poetry. It is mostly written to look at although it uses letters instead of painting brush.</p>\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Concrete Cat&rdquo; we can see Dorthi Charles has used black letters and placed it in such a manner that it shows us the picture of a cat on the page. To make the picture more vivid, he has used pointed letters. &ldquo;A&rdquo; shows the pointed ears of cat, the capital &ldquo;Y&rdquo; is used to show the wide opened eyes of cat as it is approaching food. The stripes, whiskers, mouth, paw and tail also made visible by appropriate arrangement of letters.</p>\r\n<p>The poet has also associated some catness with the concrete cat. For example a mouse is shown upside down. It means the cat has recently killed it, which is cat&rsquo;s nature. Similarly, the letter &ldquo;U&rdquo; is used mouth to suggest that a cat licks its food. There are some litter boxes at the corner, which suggests that the cat is in a storeroom. The food kept near it also suggests that the cat is a domestic one.</p>\r\n<p>The poet has also used a pun in the poem. A pun is a device of figurative language in which a word with two meanings is playfully used in a context. The punning words are spelled and pronounced in the same way. We find the mid stripe on the cat&rsquo;s body can be read as &ldquo;stripe&rdquo;, which means a long extended black line on a cat&rsquo;s body.

The poet uses visual appearance on the page to create a poem, this kind of poem are rather Imaginative, More ever, the poet &ldquo;Dorthi Chales&rdquo; also used Pun in the poem like a usual traditions, Here Strip can be read as Stripe and tripes. Stripes are relatively long band or texture and tripers area stomach tissue of an animal used as a food or useless things.

How&rsquo;s That Again&rdquo; is an essay written by Rosenblatt and this essay has a humorous tone. Through the humorous tone also, the essayist has tried to reflect the bitter reality of human beings when they make mistake when they speak. He enriches his discussion with remarkable examples; although, as befits its subject. He is much concerned with the psychological causes of bloopers.</p>\r\n<p>Human beings often make mistake knowingly and unknowingly when they speak. After making mistake they also apologize for it. From the uneducated person to highly intellectual and educated, scholar, different mistakes are made according to their level. This essay describes the mistake the people make while speaking and the reasons behind it are divided into four categories. They are as follows: i. Public Blunders ii. Memorable Translations iii. Bloopers iv. Spoonerisms.</p>\r\n<p>Public Blunders are the mistakes made by the people when they give speech. While delivering the speech, they don&rsquo;t actually care for the grammatical mistakes or vocabulary mistakes. These mistakes are specially committed by especially by the political leaders when they deliver their speech. They try to give emphasis by giving different examples but their sentences are not totally complete. This happens due to their tongue slip. Here the speaker may be trying to give message from one view but the different audience may take it in wrong way.</p>\r\n<p>Memorable translations are the mistakes generally done by the people who speak very fast. This is also related to the psychological condition of the listener. The words spoken by the fast speaker may not be easily understood the real words. There may be misunderstanding between the speaker and listener. The person with weak psychology, if, wrongly interprets the words of the speaker, it may bring violent situation.</p>\r\n<p>Bloopers are the mistakes done foolishly and not tried to correct. These mistakes are very simple types of mistakes, which are not given much importance by the speaker. This may be the habit of some people. Spoonerisms are the mistakes, which are done by the use of incorrect words due to tongues slips. Here, wrong words are not known by the listener as the speaker immediately tries to replace the wrong word when he comes to know the mistake. While the replacement of words the speaker should be conscious as wrong replacement can misinterpret the actual meaning.</p>\r\n<p><br />There are different views about the verbal errors according to different people. Victoria Fromkin, a linguist, says that the verbal errors happen due to tongue slips concerned with the brain. Before the words are expressed, thought is placed by the brain into a grammatical framework. Sigmund Freud, a psychiatrist, presents his theory about the verbal error in different way. According to him, a tongue slips are caused by the network of id (unconscious mind), ego (subconscious mind) and superego (conscious mind). When people make mistakes, it has become the trend to laugh at them. Why do we laugh at them we don&rsquo;t know. According to the philosopher Henri Bergson, the act of laughter is caused by any interruption of normal human fluidity or momentum. So, tongue slips are like slips of banana peels. We simply make fun and hoot at the errors simply to break the monotonies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','2014-05-29 14:25:43',5,1,NULL,5,1,0,0),(29,'Oops ! How\'s That Again','<p><strong>1.

First he talks about public blunders e.g. Nancy Regan describes the voters as \"The beautiful white people\" secondly, the writers say about memorable translation. This type of error is created when \"Come alive with Pepsi\" another verbal error is blooper is generally made on TV and radio programmes. In place of saying \"Herbert Hoover\" one says \"Boobert Heever\". The fourth error is \"Spoonerisms\" once Spooner said to his students. \"You have hissed all my mystery lectures\" instead of \"You have missed all my history lectures.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. What explanation does Rosenblatt advice for the human tendency to make verbal errors?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ans: The writer examines many reasons why the speaker makes such errors. According to the writer, slip of the tongue is the main cause of the mistakes (verbal errors). Slip of the tongue is like slip on the banana peels. The thoughts in our mind are put into the grammatical order before we express them. According to Freud, the slips or the verbal errors are caused by the speaker\'s inner desires. The tongue slips also because other types or verbal errors such as blooper (stupid mistakes) and spoonerism. The writer says that nothing is perfect and ever successful.

He was born is 1861 and died in Calcutta (now Kolkata). He is famous for his poetic works, philosophical plays, novels and short stories. The poetic play, Malini, is a story of love and hatred. It also deals with the topics such as religion, faith, friendship, devotion, sacrifice, forgiveness, loyalty, betrayal, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />The play opens with the agitation of the Hindu Brahmins for the banishment of Malini, the princess of Kashi. A Hindu kingdom. Malini has been charged for her acceptance of a new creed, i.e. Buddhism. Having been taught by Buddhist Monks, she was influenced by Buddhism. She does not find any attachment with the worldly beauty and the material world. She thinks that wealth does not cling to whose destiny it is to find riches in poverty. Her mother, the Queen opines that for a woman, husband and children are the objects of worship.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The king and the Queen are worried about her acceptance of Buddhism and request her to give up her new creed. The Queen believes Malini to be a pure flame of fire and thinks some divine spirit has taken birth in her but the king does not want her to take the burden of the world on her shoulders.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Kemankar, a firm and determined youth, is the leader of agitators. Supriya, the childhood friend of Kemankar is also an agitator. Malini is charged as a poisonous snake who is aiming at the heart of Hindu religion. Supriya does not approve the idea to banish Malini in the name of religion. He knows that the truth cannot be determined by the force of numbers. He supports Malimi&rsquo;s belief that the love and truth as soul and body of all religions. Though the essence of all religions is same, Kemankar believes in their different forms. Supriya leaves the assembly assuring Kemankar about their friendship.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />All the agitators step back when they come to know that the army is in support of the agitation. They think it as a rebellion and extreme measure. They believe that their faith, not the arms, will give them victory. So make penance and invoke the goddess to descend from heaven to less and give power to them. Malini enters with all in the palace, and receives the honour of the ordinary citizens except Kemankar and Supriya. They ask for forgiveness, Malini announces her self exile and wants to make home renouncing the royal palace. Kemankar becomes alone in the agitation. So he makes a plan to go to the foreign land to bring soldiers to fight. Though Supriya does not like this plan, he wants to go with him for their friendship&rsquo;s sake. Kemankar orders him to remain there to watch and keep him informed.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The first part of the play ends with the conversation about Malini. The king shows the determination to banish Malini as the demand persisted but he immediately changes his mood when he learns about Malini&rsquo;s missing. But Malini is brought back by the Brahmins and the soldiers with a great honour.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The second part of the play opens in the garden where Malini and Supriya are talking. Supriya wants to be led by Malini but she does not think herself so great to lead him. During conversation Malini wants to learn about Kemankar from Supriya. He said that Kemankar&rsquo;s mind has always been firm and determined while his mind or thoughts are always flickering with doubts. Supriya suddenly reveals that he has deceived his friend by informing his plan to the king.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The king enters. He is very much happy with Supriya and so he proposes Supriya to ask for anything even the princess Malini along with provinces worthy to tempt a king. But he refuses all. He thinks these as rewards for his treachery. He only wants love from Malini, which she has for every creature in the world.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Kemankar has been captured by the king&rsquo;s soldiers and the king is going to execute him for his treason. Both Malini and Supriya plead the king to pardon him. He is brought before the king who wishes to meet Supriya. Since he wants to know why Supriya has done that or why he betrayed his own friend. Supriya replies he did to keep faith. He blames Supriya being a faithless. Supriya replies that true faith is there is love, where there is man. He says he got the knowledge from malini, which he could not get from any sacred books. Supriya wants to make compromise but Kemankar says falsehood and truth cannot live side by side in friendship.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Supriya assures Kemnakar that he is paying his life for his love as Kemankar knows for the faith. At this Kemankar wants them to be judged in front of the death. Then Kemankar strikes Supriya with his chains and Supriya falls and he dies. Kemankar calls for his executioner but Malini requests the king to forgive him.<br />&nbsp;</p>','2014-05-29 14:27:43',5,1,NULL,5,1,0,0),(31,'Malini','<p><strong>1. Would you call Supriya a betrayer?

Kemankar wanted to go to foreign land &nbsp;to bring armies to revolt against Malini. Supriya also wanted to go with Kemankar. Kemankar asked him to retain there and inform him. While Kemankar was in foreign land, he warns Supriya not to betray their old friendship because of the new religion. But Kemankar goes to foreign land and writes his friend about plans then Supriya informs about Kemanker\'s secret plan to the king. King captures Kemankar. In this way, Supriya can be said as a great betrayer.

Love is shown in its pure form but it also show love in its petty selfishness. This Story (play) also shows us that one&rsquo;s religion is grater by its own way. Religious Tolerance and love is the Secret to Success.</p>\r\n<p>Here, Malini Have changes to Buddhism. But the Brahmins are not happy. Hence, they have asked for banishment of malaini. The king is the reprensitive of people. He should do what other wants, majority decides. So, if only to make the citizen happy, he would have vanished Malini. Malini herself aslo asked for her Banishment. Also the prince himself wants Malini Vanished as soon as possible.<br />Hence, Since all of points are supporting banishment of MAlini. Therefore the king would have banished Malini if the revolt continued.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.Draw a Character Sketch of Supriya and Show how he is different from kemankar?</strong><br />Supriya is grey Character in the Play. His character is changing from Brahmin to Malaini. He is very supportive of his friend and is broad minded. He took other religion and believed in religious tolerance. He was Very practical minded in this way. He follows his heart as he supported Malini. But he is very fickle minded. Once he is supporting Kemankar the next he is supporting Malaini.<br />Unlike, SUpriya Kemnekar is strong headed. He blindly supported his religion, and this failed him to see tolerance between the two religions. He believed too much in his religion and bolls. He was not so practical minded. He was revengeful and competitive. This is what led him to kill supriya. He wanted war and no other religion to progress.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.What was the revolt against? Against Malini? Against the king? Against Buddhism?</strong><br />Malini, by Rabindra Nath Tagore is a story of love and hatred. Love in its pure form but it also shows how petty selfishness is ruling the world with hatred, here, Malini changes her religion and a revolt have started.</p>\r\n<p>The revolt may seem to be against Malini but the truth is the revolt is against Buddhism. Here, the Brahmins are revolting not because Malini have done anything wrong but they fear their own religion would vanish if they left some other religion grow. Due to this fear they dint want religious tolerance. <br />Hence, the revolt is against all Buddhism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.Would you call Supriya a betrayer? Give your answer.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Supriya is shown as a grey character in the story. So, it is not clear whose side he is in. He is not so strong headed and his mind keeps changing i.e. he is fickle minded. But, supriya can be called a betrayer even though he prevented war.</p>\r\n<p>The false hope he gave to his friend his lack of determination is the main cause of him being a betrayer. He could support whomever he wanted. He could go support kemanker or Malini, but he should have made clear to his friend whose side he was on. Since, he made false promises telling he would wait, he betrayed Kemamkar.<br />Hence, I would call Supriya a betrayal due to false promise.</p>','2014-05-29 14:28:21',5,2,NULL,5,1,0,0),(33,'A Worn Path','<p><strong>Trace the various obstacles old Phoenix comes is against between the valley where we first pick her up and the wagon track, and describes how she deals with each.</strong><br />For her old age, the journey itself was an obstacle for old PhonieX Jackson.

It is about the history of writer&rsquo;s mother in a delicate teacup. The two major themes of this essay are relationship between a mother and her daughter and a connection between the past generation and present generation. Both these things are represented by a teacup.</div>\r\n<div>The writer&rsquo;s mother was married in the year 1939, the beginning of the Second&nbsp;<span id=\"mm11z93r68_7\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">World War</span>. The same year she bought the teacups as gifts that were later given to the daughter. Hampel sees a connection between herself and her mother. The teacup reminds her of her mother&rsquo;s history because her mother bought it in<a name=\"more\"></a>&nbsp;1939. Through the cup the mother&nbsp;<span id=\"mm11z93r68_8\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">transfers</span>&nbsp;the<span id=\"mm11z93r68_2\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">culture and history</span>&nbsp;of her time to the daughter. So, the cup is historical memory only. It was made in Czechoslovakia, which was taken over and destroyed by the armies of Adolf Hitler.</div>\r\n<div>The essay associates and removes the objective description and subjective feeling of author and teacup. The author can express lots of feeling and&nbsp;<span id=\"mm11z93r68_4\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">ideas making</span>&nbsp;the teacup as a medium. She tries to compare the falling of flower in the teacup as destruction of beauty due to falling bombs. There was also cultural and social degradation. The style of this essay is&nbsp;<span id=\"mm11z93r68_3\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">stream of consciousness</span>. So, the reader feels somehow puzzled to track down the plot of the essay. She expresses all her feelings try to compete each other. So, some sentences are fragmented. Logically they do not follow each other. The writing is beautifully decorated but the meanings are deviated.</div>\r\n<div>There is symbolic meaning of the things. &lsquo;<span id=\"mm11z93r68_5\" class=\"mm11z93r68\">Falling flowers</span>&rsquo; implies the degrading situation and &lsquo;teacups&rsquo; were human rituals and arts. Certainly the essayist refers the fall and break of culture. &lsquo;Falling bodies&rsquo; were dying people in the war and &lsquo;beds&rsquo; have meaning of the battlefield where the falling bodies lay. &lsquo;The falling of bombs onto women&rsquo; means the tragic fate of these women. They had the disturbed married life. Fates of women were accursed by the war and their destiny was darkened by the war and their destiny. &lsquo;Falling countries&rsquo; refers to the degradation of humanity, peace, progress, brotherhood, culture, etc. of the countries involved in the war. This essay presents the reality of war and shows the real picture of the world caused by the destruction due to war.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Things that fell in 1939</strong></div>\r\n<div>country</div>\r\n<div>art</div>\r\n<div>development</div>\r\n<div>civilization</div>\r\n<div>dead bodies</div>\r\n<div>bodies of bride in bed</div>\r\n<div>tradition</div>\r\n<div>dreams and hope</div>\r\n<div>faith in marriage</div>\r\n<div>humanity</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>','2014-06-03 12:42:23',5,1,NULL,2,1,0,0),(35,'Look at the Teacup','<p>Excercise</p>\n<p><strong>Expalin &ldquo;The cup is a detail, a small unchatted finger from mid-cenyury bonfire.&rdquo;</strong><br /> &ldquo;The cup is a detail, a small unchatted finger from mid-cenyury bonfire&rdquo;. The cup in the sentence refers to the cup bought by thr writer&rsquo;s mother in 1939 which was a souviner handed to her, The Tea cup was thin, palest water green imaginable. Sometimes, in certain lights it is so pale, it doesn&rsquo;t seem green at all.It is shiny, and there are thin bands of gold cup and again midway down th bowl of the cup and it&rsquo;s base, which is subtly formed into a semi-pedestal. There is also a band of gold on the inner circle of the saucer,but it has been worn away after so many years of use. Inside the cup there are flowers, as if some one has scattered a bouquet and it had tumbled into seperate blossoms, falling in a full circke around the inside.Some had already fallen wheras some were still falling.No flowers in the cup were simillar.<br /> <br />The cup was one part of the history not beacuse it was too old but it had lived through the destruction cauesd by Second Wolrd war. Many and many things fell that yeat but the cup was still safe. In other way, the cup was safe because someone had looked after it. Here,the easiest wants to imply that the second world war could also had been avoided had they taken good steps. Bodies fell in Europe but the tea cup had no scratch on it. The second world war was the most devasting war of man kind, Many inncocent, were killed and Billions of worth Property were destroyed.And even in Barcelona, almost for the 1st time in history a woman carrying a bunch of Forsythia wrapped in waxed paper ran for cover,hidding from air.The newborns died without seeing what world had to offerm Many women wrere widowed and many childern were Orpahned.

The flowers in the tea cup fell, This symbolically represent Bombs falling from the year adn some already landed taking thousands and thousand sof inncoents lives.

For the first time bodies of bride paired with other bodies fell on bed. Our Tradition and culture lesson fell.They proved to be wrong.All dreams and hopes one had for fututre fell due to the war only because one had to serve the country.Many women were widowed and many men were killed.This decreased the faith in marriage and finally faith in marriage fell. War had made men cruel and didnt care about anyone else . So, the greatest of all humanity fell that year.</p>\n<p>So, everything fell that year from falling of flowers to humanity.</p>\n<p>How does Hampel see herself and her mother connected by the tea cup?<br />Look at the tea cup is a essay that is completly depended upon the tea cup.Here the tea cup is the medium for all questioned asked in the essay.The tea cup was brought by Hampel mother in 1939.She preserved it and handed it to her daughter.</p>\n<p>The essay talks about the realtionships of mother and daughter.In this essay the mother is a silent kind of women. Whereas her daughter is a talkative one.The daughter wants to know many things about the past.But her mother sayd that there was no significant in her life.But the daughter didnt agree.Beacuse she had survived the war. At that time even europe started to eat itself raw.The daughter however thought her life was very significant due to it. The mother passed down the teacup as a soviner. This is where all the questions start to rise.The daughter looks at the cup and all the questions abut her mother past stars to come out.This cup has helped her to understand the life of her mother life better than ever before. She understood the life of women in 1939 because of her mother. The mother doesnt talk about her life.This shows the way a women wants to keep all her pain to herself.</p>\n<p>In short, the tea cup is where all the sumberged figure starts coming out and all the past connected to her mother comes out.</p>','2014-05-29 14:38:33',5,2,NULL,5,1,0,0),(38,'Metalic conduction','<p>Metallic condution</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let us consider a metallic conductor of lenght \'\'l\" and cross-section area \"A\".

The palate is divided into anterior hard palate and interior soft palate. Anterior hard palate with transverse ridge called Rugae keeps food in proper place during mastication. Posterior soft part is a smooth surface that helps in easy swallowing. Posterior end of soft palate hangs down as a small finger like muscular flap called Uvula. It closes the internal nares during swallowing of food.</p>\r\n<h4>Tongue</h4>\r\n<p>It is a large muscular highly mobile structure lying on the floor of buccal cavity. It is attached with the floor of mouth cavity by a fold of mucous membrane called frenulum. The dorsal surface of tongue is rough due to presence of papillae.

There are 3 types of papillae.</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fujiform papillae: These are smallest, thread like structure present on the anterior 2/3 portion of Tongue.</p>\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fungiform papillae: These are numerous mushroom shaped structures present at the tip and lateral edge of tongue i.e.bar</p>\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vallate papillae: These are largest but usually 8-12 in number and are arranged in inverted V shape at the base of tongue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Function of tongue</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To taste the nature of food.</li>\r\n<li>Mastication ( chewing)</li>\r\n<li>In making the speech (articulation)</li>\r\n<li>Swallowing of food (Deglutition)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Teeth</h4>\r\n<p>Teeth are embedded in both the jaws in man. There are 3 types of teeth; thecodont, diphyodont and heterodont.</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Bunodont:</strong> Adapted for mastication</p>\r\n<p>2) <strong>Thecodont:</strong> Embedded in jaw sockets or theca&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3) <strong>Diphyodont:</strong> Having 2 sets of teeth; first set is called milk teeth or deciduous teeth which are later replaced by second set of permanent teeth.</p>\r\n<p>4) <strong>Heterodont</strong>: Set of four different shape and size of teeth</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i. Incisor-&nbsp; with the crown ( biting)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ii. Canine- for tearing</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii. Premolar- mastication</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iv. Molar- mastication</p>\r\n<p>Last molar or third molar teeth are called wisdom teeth (vestigial organ).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Structure of teeth</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each tooth comprise of crown, neck and root.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Crown</strong>: It is the exposed portion of tooth above gum. It is externally covered by hardest substance called Enamel which protects the . Beneath the Enamel, there is dentine (made of hard substance similar to bone) which is tough but not as tough as Enamel and can Decay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Neck:</strong> It is narrow portion between crown and root and is surrounded by gum.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Root:</strong> It is embedded in jaw bone and holds the tooth securely in place. Each tooth is composed of pulp cavity in the center. Pulp cavity consists of nerve fibres, blood vessels, sensory cells and odontoblast. Dentine surrounds pulp cavity. Cement is a hard substance surrounding embedded part of dentine around the root that holds the tooth inside the socket.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Function of teeth</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For mastication</li>\r\n<li>For speech production</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Pharynx</h4>\r\n<p>Pharynx is a wide opening situated behind the mouth. It is lined by mucous membrane. Its functions are to act as a common passage for air and food. It consists of 3 parts: Nasopharynx, oropharynx, Laryngopharynx.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Nasopharynx</strong></p>\r\n<p>The uppermost portion of pharynx communicating with nose through internal nares and with ear through Eustachian tube extends from mouth to the level of soft palate is called Nasopharynx.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.Oropharynx</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mid portion of pharynx acting as a common passage for air from nose to trachea and food passing from buccal cavity to oesophagus extending from soft palate to 3<sup>rd</sup> cervical is called Oropharynx.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.Laryngopharynx</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is the lowermost portion which leads into two tubes i.e gullet (good pipe) and glottis (wind pipe). In front of the glottis, there is a muscular flap called epiglottis which closes the glottis at the time of food swallow to avoid the food entering inside to trachea. It extends from third to sixth cervical</p>\r\n<h4>Oesophagus</h4>\r\n<p>It is a long narrow muscular tube of about 25 cm which connects pharynx to the stomach. Its wall is lined by stratified squamous and columnar epithelium containing mucous gland. It runs straight down through the neck behind and along the trachea. It curves upward before opening into the stomach which prevents the backflow of gastric juice or components from the stomach.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Function</strong></p>\r\n<p>Serves as a food passage by peristaltic movement of muscular wall.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Stomach</h4>\r\n<p>It is large, elastic muscular, J-shaped muscular sac situated on the left side of the abdominal cavity. It is the widest part of the alimentary canal. It is of 25-30 cm in length with capacity of 2 litres. Stomach is divided into 4 regions: Cardiac, Fundus, body and pyloric.</p>\r\n<p>The region of stomach which continues from oesophagus is called cardiac orifice and with duodenum at the pyloric orifice. The cardiac is the uppermost part which continues the oesophagus.</p>\r\n<p>The Fundus is dome shaped structure above the cardiac orifice and is generally filled with air or gas.</p>\r\n<p>The body is the main part in fundus and pylorus.</p>\r\n<p>Pylorus is the lowermost funnel shaped structure that continues to duodenum.</p>\r\n<p>The Cardiac and pyloric region are guarded by rings of muscle called Sphincter Muscle which prevents regurgitation (backflow of food).</p>\r\n<p>The inner wall of stomach bears numerous folds called gastric rugae which disappear when stomach is full. Internally, the stomach wall consist numerous gastric glands which pour the secretion into the gastric pit or lumen. The gastric glands consist of 3 types of cells: oxyntic, peptic and Mucus cell; secreting HCL, pepsin and mucus respectively thus forming the gastric juice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Function</strong></p>\r\n<p>The food can remain in stomach for long period of time (3-4 hrs).</p>\r\n<p>It is temporary reservoir of food</p>\r\n<p>Churning of food</p>\r\n<p>Hydrolysis or semi digestion of food (proteins) to make chime.</p>\r\n<p>Absorption of some amount of food i.e. water, glucose, alcohol.</p>\r\n<p>Muscular action of stomach mixes the food with Gastric juice that makes food soft and helps the enzymes to act on it</p>\r\n<p>HCl destroys many micro-organisms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4>Small Intestine</h4>\r\n<p>It is long narrow, tubular and coiled structure about 6.5 metres long lying in abdominal cavity. It is divided into 3 parts: Duodenum, Jejunum and ileum.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Duodenum</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is C-shaped structure and 25cm in length and 2.5 cm in breadth. It consists of Brunner&rsquo;s gland and crypts of lieberkuhm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jejunum</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is narrow than duodenum measuring about 1.5-1.8 in length. It is more or less in similar to ileum in structure and function.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ileum</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is the last part of the small intestine which is highly coiled about 3.5 m in length and lie within the inverted U-shaped limb of colon of large intestine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Function of small intestine</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Complete digestion of food</li>\r\n<li>Absorption of nutrients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>Large intestine</h4>\r\n<p>It is wider and shorter than small intestine, measuring about 1.5-1.8 m in length.

The ancient people also knew about this technology as preparation of alcohol, curd, cheese, butter, churpi, Gundruk, etc. but they didn&rsquo;t know about cause of such fermented products. Nowadays it has been advanced rapidly in the field of biochemistry, microbiology, biomolecule, genetic engineering, tissue culture, etc. hence biotechnology can be used in different field in different ways.</p>\r\n<p>Application of biotechnology in the field of Agriculture,</p>\r\n<p>Application of biotechnology in the field of Medicine, &amp;</p>\r\n<p>Application of biotechnology in the field of Industry.</p>\r\n<h4>Application of biotechnology in the field of Agriculture</h4>\r\n<p>Biotechnology plays important role in the field of agriculture, floriculture, horticulture, forestry, etc. The main objectives of this technology in this field are</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Production of disease free plants.</li>\r\n<li>Improvise the quality and quantity of plant products, &amp;</li>\r\n<li>Production of new variety of plants having desirable characters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These all factors gave benefit to mankind and other forms of life.</p>\r\n<h5>Significant application in this field</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><em>Tissue culture</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>A modern technology, defined as a cultivation of isolated microorganisms (algae, fungi, bacteria) and parts of higher plants or animals (cell, tissue, organ) in the aseptic container containing artificially prepared medium under controlled environment.</p>\r\n<p>From this method we can produce numerous plantlets within short period of time in a small area. These plantlets are called clones. Then these clones are grown in different environment where they grow rapidly and give good production. Besides these, by this method we can produce off-seasonal plants so that vegetables &amp; fruits can be available throughout the year. It is very simple, easiest and cheapest method and can be applied in any season by any person. E.g.:- Potato, Banana, orchids</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><em>Meristem culture for production of fisease free plant</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As we know that meristemetic tissue are newly formed cells found in shoot and root apex.

Time is the leader which can make a sage the King and the King a sage. So, we shouldn&rsquo;t be proud of earthly &nbsp;greatness as we have.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;On the Vanity of Worldly Things&rdquo; is a poem written by Arthur Guiterman, an American poet and journalist, is best known for his humorous verse. Through humour, he has tried to depict the reality of human beings and animals caused by the change in time. It shows the bitter reality that the power of animals or human beings doesn&rsquo;t remain same when time and situation change. We always run after reputation and prestige. We become or want to be great and we think it will remain the same forever. We earn reputation and prestige and we think it will remain the same forever. We earn reputation and we think that the credit won&rsquo;t be lost but actually we won&rsquo;t think that is destroyed in due course of time. Our greatness is dismissed by time. So, time laughs at our blindness and pride.</p>\r\n<p>Time is such a thing on which we cannot get victory. The nature has given us limited time to live and exercise our power. Beyond that time, we cannot move according to our desire. Only in favourable time and situation we can perform our actions or activities.</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; actually means the degrading value of reputations of any persons and animals in the world. To clarify this point the writer has presented few examples. Julius Caesar was a great warrior and a famous general statesman. He earned a great name and fame in his time through his strength and power. But that power lost its value with the change in the time and situation. He does not posses any arm and power to show his power of the past. His head is on the shelf and weapons and other things belongings are only in the museum in the form of history.</p>\r\n<p>The roman emperor Charlemagne was a great in his time by his sword, power. But the power of his sword also became meaningless due to the change in time. Now that sword has been rusted and is kept useless in the museum. Not only the great kings and warriors, but there is also good presentation of powerful animals whose value has been decreased. Grizzly bear, whose embrace was very dreadful, has become nothing more than a rug to give warmth. Tusks of mighty brawls of mastodons have been changed into playing things like billiard balls.</p>\r\n<p>All the given examples are concerned with the greatness but the greatness has been turned and reduced to valueless things. The vanity human greatness and animals&rsquo; strength have become a good subject to present irony.

She presents something unusual about the disease in a more philosophical and meditative domain of thought.</p>\r\n<p>Joan spends her day in bed there almost five times a month because of the migraine headache. She knows that she is going to be attacked by the headache when she feels some sort of irritation and flow of blood in the vessels of her brain. To avoid the attack she takes some medicines and starts to work. In her earlier days, she thought that she would get rid of the disease just by denying it. Sometimes she even tells lies saying that she did not have the attack frequently. But the truth was that sometimes the attack was quite violent and long lasting. However, she feels good that she does not have any other physical problems, such as brain tumor, eyestrain or high blood pressure. She also tries to do all her normal work in spite of it. During the attack her right temple (head) would suffer extreme pain and tears would roll down from her right eyes. She would also vomit. Generally the headache may also be caused by stress, allergy, and tiredness, an abrupt change in blood pressure, a flashing light or a fire drill.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s strange that no medicine works effectively in case of migraine, especially when the attack begins. Some people may have hallucination, blinding effect, stomach problem, tiredness and pain in all the senses along with headache. They are even unable to do their normal work. During the attack Didion can&rsquo;t see and speak clearly. She looks as if she has drunk some wine. But the headache never takes anyone&rsquo;s life. It is interesting to know what doctors believe about a migraine sufferer. They said that the individual is ambitious, inward, and intolerance of unbearable pain But Didion&rsquo;s untidy hair and carelessness in house keeping do not point out her migraine quality. However her great effort to write and rewrite a single paragraph for a week reveals some sort of perfection. Finally she accepts the diseases and lives with it. When she has it she simply concentrates on the pain. But after ten or twelve hours she gets some sort of refreshment and spiritual power. She opens the window and feels the air, eats gratefully and sleeps well. She feels as if she is blessed by God. Therefore she is happy.</p>','2014-06-05 13:51:27',5,1,NULL,2,1,0,0),(53,'The Gardener','<p><strong>The Gardener</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Rudyard Kipling</p>\r\n<p>Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), a British poet, novelist, and the writer of short stories was born in India and set many of his writings in the Indian flavor.

Actually it was not so. She had created a false story about Michael&rsquo;s parents. Michael was born when Helen was in southern part of France. She had told lies about her trip that she had long troubles. Because of the fear of social stigma she had told another lie that she had arranged for the passage of the child and a nurse from Bombay. She was thirty-five when she gave birth to the child. She showed much fondness to the child despite the fact that she was not the child lover.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Michael was fearless, Philosophical, and fairly good-looking. At the age of six, he knew that Helen was not her real mother but his aunt. She did not allow Michael to say her mummy because she was unmarried. To escape from the society&rsquo;s contempt, she made Michael know the false reality.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Michael got maturity in due course of time but his interest in Helen was constant and increasing throughout. Though Helen wanted him to go to Oxford University, he took war as his career. The First World War was going on. Many soldiers were killed during war. Michael was killed by the shell-splinter explosion. After getting full proof about his death, Helen, being a next of &ndash;kin, prepared to go and see his grave in Hazenzeelein the third Military Cemetery with perfect information.</p>\r\n<p>In a teashop, three kilometers away from cemetery, she met an English Woman, Mrs. Scarsworth. They stopped in a hotel where Mrs. Scarsworth revealed that she had come there to see the grave of someone special to her and also that she was unmarried. Helen told lie that she had come to see her nephew&rsquo;s grave.</p>\r\n<p>Next morning she walked alone towards the grave. As she was searching at the mean time she saw a man knelt behind a line of headstones-evidently a gardener. He did not introduce with her neither did he salute her. He asked her who she was looking for. She said it was Lieutenant Michael Turrell, her nephew. He had finite compassion in his expression and eyes. He said he would show her where her &lsquo;son&rsquo; lay.

Genetics is the modern science in which we study about Heredity and Variation. And it is the vast subject which includes; Structure, number, behavior (normal &amp; abnormal) &amp; function of chromosome as well as Cell division; Mitosis-differentiation-growth &amp; development; Meosis-gamete-reproduction-young ones.</p>\n<h4>Heredity</h4>\n<p>In sexually reproducing organism certain characters are transferred from parent to progeny such character are called Heredity characters.</p>\n<p>Heredity can be defined as- &ldquo;It is a transmission of heredity characters from one generation to another through gametes.</p>\n<h5>Ancient views about heredity</h5>\n<p>Till 19<sup>th</sup> century people believed the theory of blending inheritance.</p>\n<p>According to this theory, male and female&rsquo;s substance mix together in the progeny &amp; blended then the progeny show intermediate characters between the parents, such concept was explained by different scientists in different way.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Moist vapor theory:- According to this theory, male introduce some male vapors inside the female body where these vapor are fused together to form embryo and that embryo develops into young ones.</li>\n<li>Fluid theory:- This theory was explained by Aristotle. According to it, female menstrual fluid mixed with the semen of male; after fertilization that mixture develops embryo and embryo into young ones.</li>\n<li>Preformation theory:- it is given by Leewenhook. As per it, there are some small tiny animalcules in the sperm and egg which is called Homuncules which are mixed and produced zygote that develops into organized body.</li>\n<li>Pangensis Theory:- Given by Darwin, proposes that there are some substances in the somatic cells which are transferred in the germ cells where they are fused and formed embryo develops into organized body.</li>\n<li>Epigenesis theory:- Given by Wolf, depicts that there are some unorganized substances in the germ cells which are fused and formed embryo develops into organized body.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the above theories failed to explain in some cases. E.g.:- Black horse crossed with White horse results Black Horse. Certain characters shown by progeny are not found in parents but found in grandparents. Thus, all these theories were discarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Later Gregor Johann Mendel also worked in the heredity and he explained that certain factors are transferred from parent to progeny which show similar and dissimilar characters. Nowadays the Mendel&rsquo;s factor is known as DNA or gene. Thus DNA is chemical basis of Heredity.</strong></p>\n<h4>Variation</h4>\n<p>Variation can be defined as a, morphological, physiological, and genetical differences among the progeny of same parent and with their parent.

This theory is based on religious faith.According to Hindu Mythology, the god of creation is Brahma. He created universe and human beings.According to Christian thought the god created universe, earth, plants, animals, and man within seven days.</p>\n<p><strong>Theory of spontaneous generation</strong></p>\n<p>According to this theory, the life originates spontaneously from the non-living things. For example the frog, toad, snake originated from mud. The insects and flies originated from the fruit juices and the microorganisms originated from air and water.</p>\n<p><strong>Theory of Biogenesis</strong></p>\n<p>According to this theory, the life originated from preexisting life but not spontaneously. Francis Redi and Louis Pasteur proved this.</p>\n<p><strong>Reddi\'s Experiment (1688 AD)</strong></p>\n<p>He was an Italian biologist. He kept dead fish, snake, and meat in wide mouthed flasks and left them opened. He again placed same things in other flasks and sealed the mouth. He observed little white worms and larvae in opened flasks but absent in sealed flasks. He concluded that the life can arise from pre-existing life only, means some preexisting life went in open-mouthed flasks then worms and larvae were developed in open mouthed flask.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Louis Pasteur\'s Experiment (1862 AD)</strong></p>\n<p>He was French microbiologist. He conducted an experiment to prove theory of biogenesis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He poured nutrient solution into the flask.</li>\n<li>He bent the neck of the flask in the shape of S using heat.</li>\n<li>The liquid was boiled for several minutes so that the bacteria were either killed or driven out of flask.</li>\n<li>The solution was then cooled. The dust particles remained trapped at the bend of the tube. The solution remained sterile for months.</li>\n<li>When the neck was broken and flask was tilted, liquid came in contact with dust or microorganisms. Bacterial colonies or moulds appeared in the flask within a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Biochemical Theory (Modern Theory)</strong></p>\n<p>The scientific theory proposed by&nbsp;<em>A.I. Oparin in 1923 and J.B.S. Hal Dane&nbsp;</em>in 1928 is called biochemical theory or modern theory or Oparine and Haldane\'s Theory. According to this theory, the life originated through a series of bio chemical reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Origin of earth</strong></p>\n<p>About 4600 million years ago, the earth originated. The earth was a molten fireball having temperature of about 4000 to 8000 &ordm;C. The earth began to cool down and the volume decreased. During the process, the heavier elements settled towards the centre forming the crust of the earth and the lighter elements remained on the outer surface-forming atmosphere. In the atmosphere, there were free atoms like C, H, O, N etc. The free atoms combined forming molecules like O<sub>2,</sub>&nbsp;N<sub>2,</sub>&nbsp;and H2.</p>\n<p>O+O&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N+N&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H+H&hellip;&hellip;...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p><strong>Origin of Inorganic Molecules</strong></p>\n<p>Then these molecules started to combine to form inorganic molecules.</p>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>2</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NH<sub>3</sub>C+O<sub>2</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CO/CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C+H<sub>2</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CH<sub>4</sub></p>\n<p><strong>Origin of Simple Organic Molecules</strong></p>\n<p>The inorganic molecules combined to form simple organic molecules.</p>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>O + CH<sub>4</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sugar/Fatty Acid/Glycerol</p>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>O+NH<sub>3</sub>+CH<sub>4</sub>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amino Acid/Nitrogen Base</p>\n<p><strong>Origin of Complex Organic Molecules</strong></p>\n<p>The organic molecules again combined together to form complex molecules</p>\n<p>Sugar + Sugar&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starch/Glycogen/Cellulose etc.</p>\n<p>Fatty acid + Glycerol&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fats</p>\n<p>Amino Acid +Amino Acid&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protein</p>\n<p>Nitrogen Base + Sugar + Phosphoric Acid&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nucleotides\'</p>\n<p>Nucleotide + Nucleotide &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nucleic Acid (DNA/RNA)</p>\n<p>On further cooling water vapor condensed into rain and thunderstorm occurred. UV rays and electric discharge enhanced these reactions. The nucleic acid combined with protein and nucleoprotein particle formed. It was self-replicating particle and was first living particle \'the virus\'.</p>\n<p><strong>Origin of Primitive Cell</strong></p>\n<p>The complex organic molecules aggregated together forming colloidal mass called&nbsp;<strong>coacervate</strong>. The nucleic acid controlled the activities of coacervate and the fats formed a layer around it. This structure is called&nbsp;<strong>Eobiont</strong>. It was first cell like structure. The eobiont absorbed food materials from the surrounding. It was heterotroph, prokaryotic cell, and present day bacteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Origin of Heterotrophs and Autotrophs</strong></p>\n<p>Later on, some of the eobiont became able to make food by using chemical energy. So they became chemoautotroph.</p>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>S&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O + S</p>\n<p>Some other eobionts developed chlorophyll molecules, which trapped solar energy to manufacture food from CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and H<sub>2</sub>O. They became photoautotroph.</p>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>S&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p>In this way, photosynthetic organisms were originated on the earth. On other hand the heterotrophs modified and different types of animals evolved. They started to consume autotrophs and used O<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>to break down food material to release energy.</p>\n<p><strong>MILLER AND UREY\'S EXPERIMENT</strong></p>\n<p>To prove Oparin and Haldance biochemical theory of origin of life Miller and Urey in 1952 conducted an experiment. They designed an apparatus containing glass tube, flask, and gas chamber. They kept NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4,</sub>&nbsp;H<sub>2,&nbsp;</sub>CO in gas chamber and water is boiled in the flask to produce water vapor. The energy was supplied by heating and by electric sparks.The condenser was used to cool reaction. They run the experiment for a week. Finally, they analyzed the products formed within the tube. They found different organic&nbsp;compounds like fatty acid, amino acid, sugar, glycerol etc in the tube. Then they proved Oparin and Haldance\'s theory of origin of life through a series of chemical reaction among the inorganic gases under the influence of temperature, electric discharges, and cooling.&nbsp;</p>','2014-07-01 12:02:24',3,1,NULL,1,1,0,0);
